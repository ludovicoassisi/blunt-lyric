<p class="lirica">

  Did I disappoint you or let you down? <br>
  Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?<br>
  'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun<br>
  Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won<br>
  <br>
  So I took what's mine by eternal right<br>
  Took your soul out into the night<br>
  It may be over but it won't stop there<br>
  I am here for you if you'd only care<br>
  <br>
  You touched my heart you touched my soul<br>
  You changed my life and all my goals<br>
  And love is blind and that I knew when<br>
  My heart was blinded by you<br>
  <br>
  I've kissed your lips and held your head<br>
  Shared your dreams and shared your bed<br>
  I know you well, I know your smell<br>
  I've been addicted to you<br>
  <br>
  Goodbye my lover<br>
  Goodbye my friend<br>
  You have been the one<br>
  You have been the one for me<br>
  <br>
  I am a dreamer but when I wake<br>
  You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take<br>
  And as you move on, remember me<br>
  Remember us and all we used to be<br>
  <br>
  I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile<br>
  I've watched you sleeping for a while<br>
  I'd be the father of your child<br>
  I'd spend a lifetime with you<br>
  <br>
  I know your fears and you know mine<br>
  We've had our doubts but now we're fine<br>
  And I love you, I swear that's true<br>
  I cannot live without you<br>
  <br>
  Goodbye my lover<br>
  Goodbye my friend<br>
  You have been the one<br>
  You have been the one for me<br>
  <br>
  And I still hold your hand in mine<br>
  In mine when I'm asleep<br>
  And I will bear my soul in time<br>
  When I'm kneeling at your feet<br>
  <br>
  Goodbye my lover<br>
  Goodbye my friend<br>
  You have been the one<br>
  You have been the one for me<br>
  <br>
  I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow<br>
  I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow<br>
