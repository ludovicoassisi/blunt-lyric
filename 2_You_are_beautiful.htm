<p class="lirica">
  My life is brilliant <br><br>
  My life is brilliant<br>
  My love is pure<br>
  I saw an angel<br>
  Of that I'm sure<br>
  She smiled at me on the subway<br>
  She was with another man<br>
  But I won't lose no sleep on that<br>
  'Cause I've got a plan<br><br>
  You're beautiful<br>
  You're beautiful<br>
  You're beautiful, it's true<br>
  I saw your face in a crowded place<br>
  And I don't know what to do<br>
  'Cause I'll never be with you<br><br>
  Yes, she caught my eye<br>
  As we walked on by<br>
  She could see from my face that I was<br>
  Fuckin' high<br>
  And I don't think that I'll see her again<br>
  But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end<br><br>
  You're beautiful<br>
  You're beautiful<br>
  You're beautiful, it's true<br>
  I saw your face in a crowded place<br>
  And I don't know what to do<br>
  'Cause I'll never be with you<br><br>
  La-la-la-la<br>
  La-la-la-la<br>
  La-la-la-la, la<br><br>
  You're beautiful<br>
  You're beautiful<br>
  You're beautiful, it's true<br>
  There must be an angel with a smile on her face<br>
  When she thought up that I should be with you<br>
  But it's time to face the truth<br>
  I will never be with you<br>
