<p class="lirica">
  Judging by the look on the organ-grinder, <br>
  He'll judge me by the fact that my face don't fit<br>
  It's touching that the monkey sits on my shoulder<br>
  He's waiting for the day when he gets me,<br>
  <br>
  But I don't need no alibi - I'm a puppet on a string<br>
  I just need this stage to be seen<br>
  We all need a pantomime to remind us what is real<br>
  Hold my eye and know what it means<br>
  <br>
  'Cause I'm out of my mind<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind<br>
  <br>
  Judging by the look on the organ-grinder,<br>
  He'll judge me by the fact that my face don't fit<br>
  It's touching that the monkey sits on my shoulder<br>
  He's waiting for the day when he gets me,<br>
  <br>
  But I won't be your concubine I'm a puppet not a whore<br>
  I just need this stage to be seen<br>
  Won't you be a friend of mine to remind me what is real?<br>
  Hold my heart and see that it bleeds<br>
  <br>
  'Cause I'm out of my mind<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind<br>
  <br>
  'Cause I'm out of my mind<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind,<br>
  I'm out of my mind<br>
