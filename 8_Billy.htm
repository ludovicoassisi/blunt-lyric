<p class="lirica">
  Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going). <br>
  Holds his head in disgrace (he can't escape the truth).<br>
  He knows the price that he's paid.<br>
  He admits that it's too late to admit that he's afraid.<br>
  <br>
  Tomorrow comes, sorrow becomes his soul mate.<br>
  The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.<br>
  Old doors are closed but he's always open,<br>
  To relive time in his mind.<br>
  Oh Billy.<br>
  <br>
  Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going).<br>
  He's got lines on his face (they tell the story of his pain).<br>
  He accepts it's his fate.<br>
  He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong.<br>
  <br>
  Tomorrow comes, sorrow becomes his soul mate.<br>
  The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.<br>
  Old doors are closed but he's always open,<br>
  To relive time in his mind.<br>
  Oh Billy.<br>
  <br>
  Once he was a lover sleeping with another.<br>
  Now he's just known as a cheat.<br>
  And he wish he'd had a mirror, looked a little clearer.<br>
  Seen into the eyes of the weak.<br>
  <br>
  Tomorrow comes, sorrow becomes his soul mate.<br>
  The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.<br>
  Old doors are closed but he's always open,<br>
  To relive time in his mind.<br>
  Oh Billy.<br>
