<p class="lirica">
  I just can't believe that it's over<br>
  We were chilling out on the sofa<br>
  Digging how the guitar goes<br>
  In a song that no one knows<br>
  Did you lick that line yourself<br>
  Or did the voodoo magic help?<br>
  Does everyone have a different take?<br>
  Do you seem real but I seem fake?<br>
  Does everyone get hypnotized by your fire?<br>
  <br>
  So long Jimmy, so long<br>
  Though you only stayed a moment<br>
  We all know that you're the one singing<br>
  So long Jimmy, so long<br>
  Sure we're glad for the experience<br>
  We miss you now you've gone<br>
  We're just swimming in your soul<br>
  'Cause we all wish we wrote this song<br>
  Life goes on<br>
  <br>
  I'm just so relieved that it's over<br>
  We were hanging out, going nowhere<br>
  Digging how the guitar goes<br>
  In a song that no one knows<br>
  Did you burn that bridge yourself<br>
  Or did the voodoo magic help?<br>
  Does everyone have a different take?<br>
  Are you just cool and I'm just baked?<br>
  Does everyone get mesmerized by your fire?<br>
  <br>
  So long Jimmy, so long<br>
  Though you only stayed a moment<br>
  We all know that you're the one singing<br>
  So long Jimmy, so long<br>
  Sure we're glad for the experience<br>
  We miss you now you've gone<br>
  We're just swimming in your soul<br>
  'Cause we all wish we wrote this song<br>
  Life goes on<br>
