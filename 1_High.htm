  Beautiful dawn - lights up the shore for me <br>
  There is nothing else in the world<br>
  I'd rather wake up and see (with you)<br>
  Beautiful dawn - I'm just chasing time again<br>
  Thought I would die a lonely man, in endless night<br><br>
  But now I'm high; running wild among all the stars above<br>
  Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me<br><br>
  Beautiful dawn (beautiful dawn)- melt with the stars again<br>
  Do you remember the day when my journey began?<br>
  Will you remember the end (of time)?<br>
  Beautiful dawn (beautiful dawn)<br>
  You're just blowing my mind again<br>
  Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine<br><br>
  High; running wild among all the stars above<br>
  Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me<br><br>
  Will you be my shoulder when I'm grey and older?<br>
  Promise me tomorrow starts with you<br>
  Getting high; running wild among all the stars above<br>
  Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me<br><br>
  Cry; running wild among all the stars above<br>
  Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me<br><br>
