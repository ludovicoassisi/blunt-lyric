<p class="lirica">
  How I wish I could surrender my soul <br>
  Shed the clothes that become my skin<br>
  See the liar that burns within my needing<br>
  How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold<br>
  How I wish I had screamed out loud<br>
  Instead I've found no meaning<br>
  <br>
  I guess it's time I run far, far away, find comfort in pain<br>
  All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble<br>
  Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray<br>
  I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble<br>
  It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain<br>
  <br>
  How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind<br>
  Hold memory close at hand<br>
  Help me understand the years<br>
  How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell<br>
  How I wish I would save my soul<br>
  I'm so cold from fear<br>
  <br>
  I guess it's time I run far, far away, find comfort in pain<br>
  All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble<br>
  Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray<br>
  I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble<br>
  Far, far away, find comfort in pain<br>
  All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble<br>
  It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain<br>
  <br>
  Oh<br>
  Tears and rain<br>
  Oh<br>
  Tears and rain<br>
  <br>
  Far, far away, find comfort in pain<br>
  All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble<br>
  It's more than just words<br>
  It's just tears and rain<br>
