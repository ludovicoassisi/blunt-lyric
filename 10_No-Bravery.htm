Back to Bedlam

<p class="lirica">
  There are children standing here<br>
  Arms outstretched and to the sky<br>
  Tears drying on their face<br>
  He has been here<br>
  Brothers lie in shallow graves<br>
  Fathers lost without a trace<br>
  A nation blind to their disgrace<br>
  Since he's been here<br>
  <br>
  And I see no bravery<br>
  No bravery<br>
  In your eyes anymore only sadness<br>
  And I see no bravery<br>
  No bravery<br>
  In your eyes anymore only sadness<br>
  Only sadness<br>
  <br>
  Houses burnt beyond repair<br>
  The smell of death is in the air<br>
  A woman weeping in despair says<br>
  He has been here<br>
  Tracer lighting up the sky<br>
  It's another family's turn to die<br>
  A child afraid to even cry out says<br>
  He has been here<br>
  <br>
  And I see no bravery<br>
  No bravery<br>
  In your eyes anymore only sadness<br>
  And I see no bravery<br>
  No bravery<br>
  In your eyes anymore only sadness<br>
  Only sadness<br>
  <br>
  There are children standing here<br>
  Arms outstretched and to the sky<br>
  But no one asks the question why<br>
  He has been here<br>
  Old men kneel to except their fate<br>
  Wives and daughters cut and raped<br>
  A generation drenched in hate says<br>
  he has been here<br>
  <br>
  And I see no bravery<br>
  No bravery<br>
  In your eyes anymore only sadness<br>
  And I see no bravery
  No bravery<br>
  In your eyes anymore<br>
  <br>
  Anymore, anymore, anymore<br>
  <br>
  And I see no bravery<br>
  No bravery<br>
  In your eyes anymore only sadness<br>
  And I see no bravery<br>
  No bravery<br>
  In your eyes anymore only sadness<br>
  Only sadness<br>
