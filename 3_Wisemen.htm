She said to me, "Go steady on me <br>
Won't you tell me what the wise men said?<br>
When they came down from Heaven<br>
Smoked nine until seven<br>
All the shit that they could find<br><br>
But they couldn't escape from you<br>
Couldn't be free of you<br>
And now they know there's no way out<br>
And they're really sorry now for what they've done<br>
They were three wise men just trying to have some fun"<br><br>
Look who's alone now<br>
It's not me, it's not me<br>
Those three wise men<br>
They've got a semi by the sea<br><br>
Got to ask yourself the question<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Got to ask yourself the question<br>
Where are you now?<br><br>
Really sorry now<br>
They weren't to know<br>
They got caught up in your talent show<br>
With you persnickety little bastards in your fancy dress<br><br>
Who just judge each other and try to impress<br>
But they couldn't escape from you<br>
Couldn't be free of you<br>
And now they know there's no way out<br><br>
And they're really sorry now for what they've done<br>
They were three wise men just trying to have some fun<br><br>
Look who's alone now<br>
It's not me, it's not me<br>
Those three wise men<br>
They've got a semi by the sea<br><br>
Got to ask yourself the question<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Got to ask yourself the question<br>
Where are you now?<br><br>
Look who's alone now<br>
It's not me, it's not me<br>
Those three wise men<br>
They've got a semi by the sea<br>
Got to ask yourself the question<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Got to ask yourself the question<br>
Where are you now?<br><br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br><br>
Got to ask yourself the question<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Got to ask yourself the question<br>
Where are you now?<br>
