<p class="lirica">
  I have seen peace. I have seen pain, <br>
  Resting on the shoulders of your name. <br>
  Do you see the truth through all their lies? <br>
  Do you see the world through troubled eyes? <br>
  And if you want to talk about it anymore, <br>
  Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder, <br>
  I'm a friend. <br>
   <br>
  I have seen birth. I have seen death. <br>
  Lived to see a lover's final breath. <br>
  Do you see my guilt? Should I feel fright? <br>
  Is the fire of hesitation burning bright? <br>
  And if you want to talk about it once again, <br>
  On you I depend. I'll cry on your shoulder. <br>
  You're a friend. <br>
   <br>
  You and I have been through many things. <br>
  I'll hold on to your heart. <br>
  I wouldn't cry for anything, <br>
  But don't go tearing your life apart. <br>
   <br>
  I have seen fear. I have seen faith. <br>
  Seen the look of anger on your face. <br>
  And if you want to talk about what will be, <br>
  Come and sit with me, and cry on my shoulder, <br>
  I'm a friend. <br>
  And if you want to talk about it anymore, <br>
  Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder, <br>
  I'm a friend. <br>
